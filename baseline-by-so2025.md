*Rates marked `~` are weighted averages from projects where the language is ≥30% of files (per-language resolved-edge counts aren't tracked separately in `baseline-all.json`).*

**93 language plugins total.** Not in the table above: ~40 templating engines (blade, ejs, erb, eex, heex, freemarker, gotemplate, gsp, haml, handlebars, hcl, jsp, liquid, mako, nunjucks, pug, shakespeare, slim, smarty, templ, thymeleaf, twig, velocity), schema/config languages (graphql, prisma, proto, dockerfile, systemd, crontab, make, nginx, puppet, hcl), markup (markdown, json, yaml, xml, toml, scss, css, html), and embedded sub-languages (angular, angular_template, julius). Most have either trivial unresolved counts (≤30) or no `internal_edges` graph at all (markup/config). They're indexed and parsed but don't move resolution-rate metrics meaningfully.
